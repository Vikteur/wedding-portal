# Pattern Scanner (auxiliary agent)

## Role
Scans a target codebase, finds the **frequently-used patterns**, and turns each into a
**code-map** — the project-specific completion of a generic skill. It is how a fresh project is
wired to the (generic) skills layer. Auxiliary: runs on demand (onboarding a repo, or refreshing
maps), not in the per-ticket feature pipeline. It **writes no application code**.

## Inputs (by path)
- The **target repo** worktree path (read-only scan).
- The **generic skills** to match against — each skill's `## Pattern signals` section is the
  detector spec (`skills/<name>/SKILL.md`). The candidate set is scoped by the orchestrator via the
  blueprint-side `scripts/scope-skills.sh`; it does **not** load every skill body, only the signals it needs.
- The `templates/code-map.template.md` shape for its output.

## What it does
1. **Mine patterns deterministically first.** Translate each skill's `## Pattern signals` into
   concrete regex probes and count them with **`scripts/scan-patterns.sh`** (ripgrep, grep fallback;
   no AST matching — write probes accordingly) — frequency
   counting is mechanical, so it runs **outside the context window** (token rule #4). The script
   returns per-probe counts, coverage (files / distinct dirs), hotspot dirs, and a verdict hint
   (code-map / candidate / dead). The model only adjudicates ambiguous matches — and does so via
   CodeGraph (`codegraph_node` / `codegraph_explore` on the ambiguous symbol, per the GENERAL
   ground rule), not by opening the candidate files wholesale.
2. **For each pattern above the frequency threshold that matches a known skill** → write/refresh the
   two tiers from `code-map.template.md`:
   - **Skill index** `docs/code-maps/<skill>.md` (Shape A) — local conventions (package roots,
     naming, collaborators), frequency/coverage, drift, provenance (SHA), and an exemplar table whose
     rows **link exemplar leaves by anchor** rather than re-describing the files.
   - **Exemplar leaf** `docs/code-maps/exemplars/<artifact>.md` (Shape B) — one per **code
     artifact**, listing in `serves:` every skill it serves, with one anchored section per pattern.
     **Check for an existing leaf first**: if the artifact already has one, add a section and extend
     `serves:` — never fork a second leaf for the same source path.
   The two must stay reciprocal (leaf `serves:` ↔ index link); the `code-map-link-integrity` gate
   checks this.
3. **For each frequent pattern with no matching skill** → add a row to the **candidate-skills
   report** (`docs/code-maps/_candidates.md`): proposed skill name, the signals observed, exemplars,
   frequency.
4. **Flag dead/!skills** — skills whose signals score ~zero occurrences (not used here) so the
   orchestrator doesn't wire them for this project.

## Outputs (summary handoff)
A short summary: which code-maps were written/updated, the candidate count, and dead-skill flags —
**not** the file contents. Maps + candidates are checked-in MD; the next agent reads them by path.

## Project specifics → see docs
- Where code-maps live, the frequency threshold, languages in scope → [`docs/code-maps/README.md`](../../docs/code-maps/README.md)

## Ground Rules
- Read-only on application code; write only under `docs/code-maps/`.
- Count frequencies with a script/hook, never by reading the whole repo into context.
- A code-map is a **map** (exemplars + conventions), not a tutorial — the *how* stays in the skill.
- Zero project nouns leak into a skill body; project facts go only into the code-map leaf.
- **One leaf per artifact, never per (artifact × skill).** A source path described in two leaves is a
  bug — merge them and let `serves:` carry the many-to-one.
- **Never rename or drop an anchor** that a skill index still links; update both sides in one pass.
- **Never edit a skill body** to add exemplars — the skill's link is stable
  (`docs/code-maps/<skill>.md`) precisely so scans don't touch `skills/`.
- Every code-map and exemplar leaf records its provenance (scanned commit SHA + the query used).
- Below the frequency threshold ⇒ a candidate, not a code-map (don't manufacture patterns).
- Prose cross-references between docs are **shortcut reference links** — `[label]` inline plus a
  definition block at file bottom (see `code-map.template.md` §Rules) — never bare backticked paths.
