# Gateway layer — always-on guardrails

> **Backstop, not a knowledge store.** Always-on for any edit in an outbound-integration module —

- Gateways isolate the outside world: no third-party SDK, wire or generated-binding type crosses
  outward past this layer.
- Every remote call carries the resilience policy (timeout, retry, circuit breaker) and a fallback
  that degrades rather than propagates a transport failure.
- Credentials, tokens and identifiers are obtained and exchanged here — never constructed inline, and
  never logged. Personal identifiers are pseudonymized before they leave.
- Translate remote faults into this system's exception vocabulary at the boundary; callers see
  domain-shaped failures, not HTTP or SOAP ones.
- No business decisions here — a gateway fetches and maps, the usecase decides.
