- **STOP and get a human decision** before a contract push, a database migration, anything touching
  authentication/authorization/the access matrix, encryption or what gets logged where personal data
  could be involved, deleting branches/history/the audit trail (except a `build-feature` run's own branch and
  worktree after its pull request is merged, UD-21.c), or production config and secrets.
  Approval is per action, not per session, and silence is not approval. Everything else is ordinary
  work — do it. None of the above is caught by a green build: a dropped column and a leaked personal identifier
  both pass CI.
- **Hand off via checked-in MD files** in the ticket's docs folder, and **report what the work tree
  shows, not what you intended** — the claim is checked against the tree, and CI enforces it on the PR.
