# guard-generated.sh — fail-closed PreToolUse hook (Claude Code): DENY hand-edits to generated code, and to the
# hook config itself.
#
# TWO rules, deliberately in different places because they have opposite update policies:
#
#   1. BUILT-IN (here, framework-owned): `.claude/hooks/*` and `.claude/settings*.json` — see the block below.
#   2. CONFIGURED (consumer-owned): the generated-path globs in `.claude/hooks/guard-generated.globs`
#      — one glob per line; `*` spans `/`, bash `[[ ]]` semantics; `#` = comment. Enforces
#      constitution P4 (contract-first): generated API clients / server stubs / DTOs are regenerated
#      from the OpenAPI spec, never hand-edited.
#
# A Write/Edit whose target path matches either is DENIED; everything else is allowed.
#
# Claude Code hook contract: JSON payload on stdin (tool_name, tool_input.file_path|command), a JSON permission decision on stdout, exit 0.
# The DENY is signalled by the `permissionDecision` field, not the exit code. This hook FAILS OPEN
# on any parse error / missing jq / missing config (emits allow) so it can never break or stall a
# session — governance that can't parse must not deny blindly.

# ── Never exit without a decision ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# MEASURED (Copilot CLI 1.0.78, three-run probe recorded in README.md): on preToolUse, a hook that
# exits non-zero WITHOUT printing a decision is treated as DENY and the operator sees
# `Denied by preToolUse hook from "..." (hook errored)` with nothing to act on. That is the lockout
# in the audit trail, and it is not a timeout - a hook that exceeds timeoutSec is ALLOWED, the
# opposite direction.
#
# This script runs `set -euo pipefail`, so ANY unanticipated non-zero - a jq that dies on a payload
# shape we did not predict, a read error on the globs file, a future edit that adds a command - kills
# it before any decision reaches stdout, and the whole session stops with an opaque message. A
# security control whose failure mode is "the human cannot work, and cannot tell why" gets disabled
# within the hour, which leaves the tree unguarded for real.
#
# So: emit a decision no matter how we leave. Fail CLOSED (deny) to keep the control's intent, but
# say what happened and how to proceed - an actionable denial instead of an inscrutable one. The
# JSON is hand-built with no interpolation because this path must survive a broken jq, which is
# exactly one of the ways we get here.

# ONE jq invocation for every field this hook needs, not one per field.
#
# This is a preToolUse hook: it runs before EVERY tool call, and on Windows each process spawn costs
# ~300ms (measured on the affected workstation: bash startup 320ms, jq startup ~330ms, `command -v
# jq` 145ms). The original shape - `command -v jq`, then a jq per field - put this hook at ~1.1s per
# tool call against a 10s `timeoutSec`: under 10x headroom on a machine where antivirus can stall a
# process spawn for seconds. A hook that DENIES on error has no safe way to be slow, because
# exceeding the budget reads as "hook errored" and blocks the operator - which is what happened in
# practice. Batching to a single spawn roughly halves the cost; the timeout was raised as well,
# because both were wrong.
#
# The `command -v jq` probe is gone rather than moved: a missing jq makes the call below fail, which
# lands in the same fail-open branch. Same behaviour, one less spawn.
#
# Fields are joined with U+0001, which cannot appear in a path or a command. NOT NUL: a bash variable
# cannot hold a NUL byte, so that idiom would silently truncate at the first field. The trailing
# sentinel keeps the output non-empty when all three fields are empty, so "jq failed" stays
# distinguishable from "nothing to extract".

# ── Rule 1b: the audit trail is not the agent's to destroy ─────────────────────────────────
# An audit trail is only evidence if it sits on a surface the acting party cannot rewrite. Rules 1
# and 2 gate Write/Edit, which does nothing here: `.apm-audit/` is destroyed with `rm -rf`, not with
# an editor. So this rule reads the SHELL tool instead — the one place an agent can reach the trail.
#
# Deliberately narrow, because a guard that fires on innocent commands gets switched off:
#   • the command must NAME .apm-audit *and* carry a destructive verb (rm/rmdir/mv/truncate/shred/
#     find -delete), or
#   • it must be `git clean` with -x/-X, which deletes ignored files and therefore takes the trail
#     out without ever naming it — the case that would otherwise look completely innocent.
# Reading, grepping, tailing, `mkdir -p` and appending are all still allowed; those are the trail
# working as intended.
#
# RESIDUAL, stated plainly: this sees the command string of a tool call. It does not stop a script
# the agent wrote and then executed, a redirect built by string concatenation, or anything that
# reaches the directory without spelling its name. The durable fix is shipping the trail off the
# workstation (see the hooks README); this closes the careless path, not the determined one.

# ── Rule 1: built-in self-protection ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# `hooks.env` holds the *_CMD values the subagentStop gates `bash -c`, and `scripts/*.sh` ARE those
# gates, so an agent that can rewrite either gets command execution at a lifecycle boundary with no
# tool-approval prompt in between. Hard-coded rather than a line in guard-generated.globs, because
# that file is CONSUMER-owned and this rule is framework-owned — three consequences of getting that
# wrong, all of which the glob version had:
#   • an upgrade must not clobber a consumer's globs file, so a framework rule shipped in it would
#     never reach any repo that already had one — i.e. every existing consumer;
#   • the opt-in default is "no globs file at all", and the check below fails open on that, so those
#     consumers would get no self-protection either;
#   • a rule protecting `.claude/hooks/*` from inside `.claude/hooks/` is circular.
# This runs BEFORE the globs-file existence check for exactly that second reason.
#
# Human-editable, agent-deny: humans change hooks directly. When hook authoring IS the session's job
# (this framework repo), the human launches it with CLAUDE_GUARD_ALLOW_HOOK_EDITS=1 — an env var on
# the CLI process, which an agent's own `bash` child cannot change. Residual, as ever: this sees
# Write/Edit tool calls, not a `bash` redirect.
# Matched case-INSENSITIVELY: `.Claude/hooks/hooks.env` is the same file on Windows (where this team
# works) and on macOS, so a case variant must not read as an unrelated path.
#
# Via `nocasematch` (bash 3.1+), NOT a lowercase-copy parameter expansion: that form is bash 4 only,
# and macOS still ships bash 3.2 as /bin/bash, where it is a `bad substitution` that kills the script
# BEFORE any allow/deny is printed. No output means no parseable decision, which per the contract
# above means fail open — so a bash-4-ism here would silently disable the ENTIRE guard, rule 2
# included, on a subset of workstations. Keep this file bash-3.2-clean; CI gates it.
